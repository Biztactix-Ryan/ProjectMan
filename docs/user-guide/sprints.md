# Sprint Planning

## Workflow

1. Run `/pm-plan` to start the sprint planning workflow
2. Review project status and audit findings
3. Prioritize backlog stories
4. Scope selected stories into tasks
5. Estimate each task
6. Assign work

## Velocity

Track velocity by comparing completed points per sprint. Use `pm_burndown` to see progress.

## Point Calibration

| Points | Effort | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | ~15 min | Fix a typo, add a config value |
| 2 | ~30 min | Add a simple endpoint, write a test |
| 3 | ~1 hour | Implement a feature with moderate complexity |
| 5 | ~half day | Multi-file feature with tests |
| 8 | ~full day | Significant feature or refactor |
| 13 | 2+ days | Consider decomposing into smaller stories |
