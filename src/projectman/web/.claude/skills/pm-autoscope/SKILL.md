# /pm-autoscope — Automated Scoping

Automates the discovery and creation pipeline for epics, stories, and tasks.

## How it works

1. Call `pm_auto_scope()` to detect the project state and get discovery signals.
2. Based on the mode returned, follow the appropriate workflow below.

## Full Scan Mode (new projects)

Triggered when no epics or stories exist yet. The tool returns codebase signals (docs, build files, source tree).

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze the codebase signals returned by `pm_auto_scope`
2. Propose 2-5 epics covering the major areas of work
3. Present the epic list to the user for approval — let them add/remove/edit
4. Create approved epics with `pm_create_epic`
5. For each epic, propose 2-6 stories
6. Present stories to the user for approval per epic
7. Create approved stories with `pm_create_story`, linking to the epic via `epic_id`
8. For each story, propose 2-6 tasks
9. Present tasks to the user for quick approval
10. Create approved tasks with `pm_create_task`
11. Show summary: N epics, N stories, N tasks created, total points

## Incremental Mode (existing stories need tasks)

Triggered when stories exist but some have no tasks. Results are paginated — the tool returns a batch of stories at a time (default 5).

**Workflow:**
1. Call `pm_auto_scope()` — returns the first batch of undecomposed stories (IDs and titles only, no bodies)
2. **For each story in the batch:**
   a. Call `pm_scope(story_id)` to get full decomposition context (story body + existing tasks + guidance)
   b. Propose 2-6 tasks for the story based on its content
   c. Present the task list to the user for quick approval (yes/edit/skip)
   d. Create approved tasks with `pm_create_tasks(story_id, tasks)` (batch — one call per story)
3. If `has_more` is true in the response, call `pm_auto_scope(offset=next_offset)` for the next batch
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all stories are scoped (`has_more` is false)
5. After all batches are done, show summary:
   - N stories scoped
   - N tasks created
   - Total points assigned
6. Suggest next steps: `/pm board` to see available work or `/pm-plan` for sprint planning

## Guidelines

- Keep task titles as verb phrases: "Add authentication middleware", "Write unit tests for parser"
- Each task should be 1-5 points (completable in one session)
- Tasks should be independently testable
- First task in a story sets up the foundation
- Last task handles integration/cleanup
- Don't over-decompose — 2-6 tasks per story is the sweet spot

## Forcing a mode

Users can force a specific mode:
- `/pm autoscope full` — force full codebase scan even if stories exist
- `/pm autoscope incremental` — force incremental even if no stories exist
