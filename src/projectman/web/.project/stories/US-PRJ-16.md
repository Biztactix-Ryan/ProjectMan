As a user, I want the web UI to work on mobile and tablet screens so that I can check project status on the go.

**Features:**
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile < 768px, tablet < 1024px, desktop)
- Collapsible nav (hamburger menu on mobile)
- Board view: horizontal scroll or stacked columns on mobile
- Tables: responsive with horizontal scroll or card layout on small screens
- Touch-friendly: larger tap targets, appropriate spacing

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All views usable on 375px width (mobile)
- Nav collapses to hamburger on small screens
- Board columns scrollable on mobile
- Tables don't break layout on small screens
- No horizontal overflow on any view
