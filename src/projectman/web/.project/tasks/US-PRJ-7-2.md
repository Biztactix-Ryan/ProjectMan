Enhance dashboard template:
- Story counts by status (backlog/ready/active/done) as badges or cards
- Task counts by status (todo/in-progress/review/done/blocked)
- Quick action links: "View Board" → /board, "Create Story" (if create form exists), "Run Audit" → /audit
- Style counts as a grid or card layout
