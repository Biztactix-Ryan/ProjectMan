Phase 2: Server-rendered UI with Jinja2 templates and HTMX for interactivity. Covers dashboard, kanban board, CRUD views for epics/stories/tasks, documentation editor, audit findings, and burndown chart.

**Success criteria:**
- All major views rendered server-side (no JS build step)
- HTMX provides partial page updates and drag-drop on board
- Inline editing on detail views
- Markdown rendering for story/task bodies
- Consistent layout with navigation across all pages
