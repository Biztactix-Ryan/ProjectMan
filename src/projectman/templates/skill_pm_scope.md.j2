# /pm-scope — Story Scoping

1. Call `pm_scope(story_id)` to get story details and decomposition guidance
2. Analyze the story and propose a task breakdown:
   - Each task should be 1-5 points
   - Tasks should be independently testable
   - Include implementation + testing in each task
   - First task sets up foundation
   - Last task handles integration
3. Present the proposed tasks to the user
4. On approval, create each task with `pm_create_task`
5. Estimate each task with `pm_estimate`
