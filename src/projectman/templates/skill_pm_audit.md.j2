# /pm-audit — Project Audit

1. Call `pm_audit` to run all audit checks
2. Present findings grouped by severity:
   - **Errors** — Must fix (e.g., done stories with incomplete tasks)
   - **Warnings** — Should address (e.g., stale items, undecomposed stories)
   - **Info** — Nice to fix (e.g., thin descriptions, point mismatches)
3. For each finding, suggest a resolution:
   - Done story with incomplete tasks → complete or reopen the story
   - Undecomposed story → run /pm-scope
   - Stale in-progress → check with assignee or re-estimate
   - Point mismatch → re-estimate story or tasks
   - Thin description → flesh out the description
